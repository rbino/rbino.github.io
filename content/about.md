Hi, I'm Riccardo!

I live in Padova (Italy) and I'm a software developer.

My main areas of expertise are backend and embedded development, but I'm
always looking for new fields to explore.

I like trying as many programming languages as I can since every one of them
usually offers some kind of new insight.

I also like messing with other stuff like music, electronics and cooking.

You can contact me at `rbino [at] gmx.com`.
