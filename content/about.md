Hi, I'm Riccardo!

I live in Padova (Italy) and I'm a software developer.

I'm a programming languages enthusiast and I like to try them all to see if I can learn something
new. Currently I'm mainly focused on backend development with Elixir and embedded development
with Qt/C++ and QML. [Amongst my weaponry](https://i.imgur.com/L0t7cZq.jpg) are such diverse
programming languages as: Python, Go, C, Elm, Lisp and Verilog. 

I love all kinds of music: I play [GameBoy](https://soundcloud.com/rbino "rbino"),
[guitar](https://thesniperspunkrock.bandcamp.com "The Snipers") and basically everything
that I can put my hands on and makes a sound. Recently I've been experimenting with live coding
using TidalCycles, so that I can do both my favorite things (writing code and making music) at the
same time.

You can contact me at `rbino [at] gmx.com`.
