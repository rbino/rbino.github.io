Hi, I'm Riccardo!

During the day I mostly do backend development using Elixir, but I also like messing with other
stuff like embedded development, electronics, music, and cooking.

I'm a strong believer in having many different tools in the toolbelt to avoid using a hammer to
plant screws.

I'm a big yak shaver and I tend to start a new project before I'm finished with the old one. This
blog is also meant to force myself into finishing things so I can write about them.
