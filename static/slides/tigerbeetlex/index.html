            - Riccardo Binetti (rbino)
            - Senior Backend Developer @ Remote
            - Using Elixir as main language since 2017

            notes:
            My name is Riccardo Binetti, you might also know me online as rbino. I currently work as a Senior Backend Developer at Remote, and I've been happily using Elixir as my main language since about 2017.
            So let's start with a question:

            ---

            # What is a transaction?

            ---
            Postgres tutorial - 3.4 Transactions

            ```postgres [|1|3-9|5,9|11|13-23|25]
            BEGIN;

            SELECT balance FROM accounts
            WHERE name = 'Alice'
            FOR UPDATE;

            SELECT balance FROM accounts
            WHERE name = 'Bob'
            FOR UPDATE;

            -- Application side checks

            UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
            WHERE name = 'Alice';

            UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
            WHERE name = 'Bob';

            INSERT INTO transfers (name, type, amount, transfer_time)
            VALUES ('Alice', 'debit', 100.00, now());

            INSERT INTO transfers (name, type, amount, transfer_time)
            VALUES ('Bob', 'credit', 100.00, now());

            COMMIT;
            ```

            notes:
            The term has different meanings, and in fact Postgres documentation
            shows something that is both:
            - A database transaction
            - A financial transaction

            - Application checks
              - Can be dynamic, not always implementable at the DB level

            - Can also be called transaction/posting
              - We're going to use transfer

            The important thing to notice: we're now at 6 SQL queries
              - We didn't even record the balance "snapshot"

            ---

            ## 1 Financial Transaction
            ## ~10 SQL queries

            notes:
            The example is deliberately simple, but financial systems in the real world
            execute between 10 and 20 SQL queries for each financial transactions.
            Moreover transactions are not easy to shard.

            ---

            🔥 Hot accounts 🔥

            ```postgres [|3]
            SELECT quantity FROM holdings
            WHERE stock_symbol = 'NVDA'
            FOR UPDATE;
            ```

            notes:
            - Pareto: 20% of accounts is involved in 80% of transactions

            ---

            #### We live in an increasingly transactional world

            notes:
            - Online shops
            - Real time payments
              - UPI in India (2019: 10B, Jan '24 12B)
              - Pix in Brazil (10M transactions/day)
            - Renewable energy
              - Making transacting energy prices more often convenient

            ### How do we scale financial transactions?

            > TigerBeetle is a reliable, fast, and highly available database for financial accounting

            notes:
            There are many tricks up TigerBeetle's sleeve, but the most fundamental one is

            ---

            ## Speaks the language of
            ## financial transactions

            notes:
            Instead of using SQL

            ---

            ## 1 Financial Transaction
            ### 128 bytes, zero deserialization

            notes:
            - Contrast this single, optimized 128-byte operation with the ~10 complex SQL queries we saw earlier
            - This is a fundamental reason for TigerBeetle's performance gains

            ---

            ## Batching

            ---

            ## 1 TigerBeetle Query
            ### 8189 Transactions (1 MiB)

            notes:
            But do we have everything we need?

            ---

            ```zig[|2|3,4|5|14|7-9,11,12]
            pub const Transfer = extern struct {
                id: u128,
                debit_account_id: u128,
                credit_account_id: u128,
                amount: u128,
                pending_id: u128,
                user_data_128: u128,
                user_data_64: u64,
                user_data_32: u32,
                timeout: u32,
                ledger: u32,
                code: u16,
                flags: TransferFlags,
                timestamp: u64,
            };
            ```

            notes:
            - Who
            - How much
            - When
            - What/why/how (stored in the application or Postgres)
            - Ledger logically isolates Accounts and Transfers
              - Transfers can happen only between Accounts with the same Ledger
            - Code is application defined 

            ---

            ```zig[|2|4,6|7-9]
            pub const Account = extern struct {
                id: u128,
                debits_pending: u128,
                debits_posted: u128,
                credits_pending: u128,
                credits_posted: u128,
                user_data_128: u128,
                user_data_64: u64,
                user_data_32: u32,
                reserved: u32,
                ledger: u32,
                code: u16,
                flags: AccountFlags,
                timestamp: u64,
            };
            ```

            notes:
            Account:
            - One interesting thing to notice is that debits and credits are always positive
            - The balance is calculated subtracting one from the other, depending on the type of account
            - All richer application data goes into your Postgres

            ---

            #### TigerBeetle (OLTP) as your data plane
            #### Generic database (OLGP) as your control plane

            notes:
            - Think of TigerBeetle as the high-speed engine for your core ledger operations (the data plane).
            - You still use your regular database like Postgres/MySQL for richer application data, user info, reporting, etc. (the control plane).

            Now, performance is only one side of this. When you deal with financial data you also care about

            ## Viewstamped Replication

            notes:
            - Developed by Brian Oki and Barbara Liskov in 1988
            - One year before Paxos
            - Replicated state machine
            - The cost of consensus is amortized by batching
            - Strict serializability

            ---

            ## Storage fault tolerance

            notes:
            - TigerBeetle assumes that its disk will fail
            - The data file is bit-by-bit identical on all replicas
            - In case of a latent sector error, the error is detected and repaired without any operator involvement
              - Most consensus implementations lose data or become unavailable if the write-ahead log gets corrupted.
            - TigerBeetle uses Protocol Aware Recovery to remain available unless the data gets corrupted on every single replica
            - No file system necessary

            ---

            ![TigerStyle logo](images/tigerstyle.jpg)

            notes:
            - Tiger Style is TigerBeetle's development philosophy
            - Partially derived from NASA's power of ten rules
            - I'd suggest reading them all but here's a familiar excerpt

            ## Deterministic simulation testing

            notes:
            Everything is deterministic and can be simulated:
            - IO (Network)
            - Storage
            - 100 simulation cores = 2 centuries every day

            ## Elixir client for TigerBeetle

            ---

            ### NIF written in Zig
            #### Implemented on top of the Zig TigerBeetle client

            notes:
            This means TigerBeetlex benefits directly from the core team's work on safety, performance, and features in the underlying Zig client. We're essentially creating efficient Elixir bindings, not reinventing the wheel.

            This is how all TigerBeetle clients are implemented
            - Go
            - C#
            - Python
            - Java
            - Node

            You get:
            - Safety (TigerStyle)
            - Automatic batching

            ---

            - Message based API
            - Blocking API
            - TigerBeetle binary data `<->` Elixir structs

            ---

            ## Available Requests

            ---

            ### Write requests

            - `create_accounts`
            - `create_transfers`

            ---

            ### Read requests (by ID)

            - `lookup_accounts`
            - `lookup_transfers`

            ---

            ### Read requests (by Filter)

            - `get_account_transfers`
            - `get_account_balances`
            - `query_accounts`
            - `query_transfers`

            notes:
            - Filter-based requests have an explicit limit and are paginatable using timestamps
            - Experimental APIs

            ---

            ## Message based API

            ---

            Creating the client

            ```elixir[]
            alias TigerBeetlex.Client

            cluster_id = <<0::128>>
            addresses = ["127.0.0.1:3000"]

            {:ok, client} = Client.new(cluster_id, addresses)
            ```

            ---

            #### `client` can (and _should_) be shared

            notes:
            - Allows automatic batching
              - But it's always better to explicitly batch

            ---

            Sending a request

            ```elixir[]
            alias TigerBeetlex.Account

            account_0 = %Account{id: <<42::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}
            account_1 = %Account{id: <<43::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}

            accounts = [account_0, account_1] # Up to 8189 accounts

            {:ok, ref} = Client.create_accounts(client, accounts)
            ```

            ---

            Receiving the response

            ```elixir[]
            {:ok, response} = Client.receive_and_decode(ref)

            # Shorthand for
            #
            # receive do
            #   {:tigerbeetlex_response, ^ref, response} ->
            #     Response.decode(response)
            # end


            ---

            Receiving the response

            ```elixir[]
            def handle_info({:tigerbeetlex_response, ref, resp}, state) do
              case Response.decode(resp) do
                #...
              end
            end
            ```

            ---

            ## Blocking API

            ---

            Starting the connection

            ```elixir[|5]
            alias TigerBeetlex.Connection

            {:ok, _supervisor_pid} =
              Connection.start_link(
                name: :tb,
                cluster_id: <<0::128>>,
                addresses: ["127.0.0.1:3000"]
              )
            ```

            ---

            Sending a blocking request

            ```elixir[]
            alias TigerBeetlex.Account

            account_0 = %Account{id: <<42::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}
            account_1 = %Account{id: <<43::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}

            accounts = [account_0, account_1] # Up to 8189 accounts

            {:ok, response} = Connection.create_accounts(:tb, accounts)
            ```

            ---

            ### Message based API
            - Can plug into existing GenServer architecture
            - More flexible async handling
            - `client` needs to be passed to the process

            ---

            ### Blocking API
            - Easier to get started with
            - Centralized client
            - Could leave the caller blocked

            ---

            ## Advanced usage

            ---

            ### Error responses

            ---

            ```elixir[]
            account_0 = %Account{id: <<42::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}
            account_1 = %Account{id: <<0::128>>, ledger: 3, code: 4}

            accounts = [account_0, account_1]

            {:ok, result} = Connection.create_accounts(:tb, accounts)

            result
            # => [
            # =>   %CreateAccountsResult{
            # =>     index: 1,
            # =>     reason: :id_must_not_be_zero
            # =>   }
            # => ]
            ```

            notes:
            CHECKPOINT: 18-19 minutes

            ### Linked Events

            ---

            ```elixir[|4|12|20]
            account_0 =
              %Account{

            ### Two-Phase Transfers

            ---

            ### Reserve funds

            ```elixir[|8|9]
            pending_transfer = %Transfer{
              id: <<42::128>>,
              credit_account_id: credit_account_id,
              debit_account_id: debit_account_id,
              ledger: 1,
              code: 1,
              amount: 100,
              flags: %TransferFlags{pending: true},
              timeout: 30
            }

            Connection.create_transfers(conn, [pending_transfer])
            # => {:ok, []}
            ```

            ---

            ### Resolve funds (Post-Pending Transfer)

            ```elixir[|4,5|3]
            post_pending_transfer = %Transfer{
              id: <<43::128>>,
              amount: 100,
              pending_id: <<42::128>>
              flags: %TransferFlags{post_pending_transfer: true},
            }

            Connection.create_transfers(conn, [post_pending_transfer])
            # => {:ok, []}
            ```

            notes:
            - We can omit credit/debit account ids, ledger and code
            - Note that we still have to pass amount

            ---

            ### Resolve funds - Void

            ```elixir[|3-4]
            void_pending_transfer = %Transfer{
              id: <<43::128>>,
              pending_id: <<42::128>>
              flags: %TransferFlags{void_pending_transfer: true},
            }

            Connection.create_transfers(conn, [void_pending_transfer])
            # => {:ok, []}
            ```

            ---

            ### Resolve funds - Expire
            Automatically expires after 30 seconds

            ---

            ### TigerBeetle recipes

            - Currency exchange
            - Multi-debit/Multi-credit transfers
            - Balance-conditional transfers

            notes:
            - Balance-conditional:
              - For example you can ensure balance stays between certain bounds
              without reading it first, just by doing some transfer-combos
              with some control accounts

            ---

            ## ⚠️ Caveats ⚠️

            notes:
            - Here are some things that might be different from your usual DB

            ---

            ### The app or browser should generate the ID

            notes:
            1. User initiates a transfer.
            2. Client software (app, web page, etc) generates the transfer id.
            3. Client software persists the id in the app or browser local storage.
            4. Client software submits the transfer to your API service.
            5. API service includes the transfer in a request.
            6. TigerBeetle creates the transfer with the given id once and only once.
            7. TigerBeetle responds to the API service.
            8. The API service responds to the client software.

            ---

            ### Timestamps are created by the server

            notes:
            - Two events can't have the same timestamp
            - Everthing is strictly serializable

            ---

            ### Requests are retried forever

            notes:
            Not a problem if you are just waiting for a message

            This client behaviour guarantees durability – the request will eventually get through if the cluster recovers

            A client session will automatically retry a request until either:
            - the client receives a corresponding reply from the cluster, or
            - the client is terminated.

            So

            - the TigerBeetle client will never time out
            - the TigerBeetle client has no retry limits
            - the TigerBeetle client does not surface network errors

            With TigerBeetle’s strict consistency model, surfacing these errors at the client/application level would be misleading.

            ### NIF communicates with Elixir via messages

            ---

            ```zig[]
            fn on_completion(context: *RequestContext, ...) {
              // ...
              const tag = beam.make_atom(env, "tigerbeetlex_response");
              const msg = beam.make_tuple(env, .{ tag, ref, response });

              beam.send(caller_pid, env, msg) catch {};
            }
            ```

            notes:
            - NIFs are not only sync chunks of C code
            - If they have their own async mechanism, they can send messages too
            - They can't receive them though (you need a CNode for that)

            ## Zig superpowers

            ---

            ### Allocations show up in `:erlang.memory()`

            notes:
            - Derived from `enif_alloc` erl_nif.h, but Zig makes it easy to integrate everywhere

            ---

            ### Code generation using Zig `comptime`

            notes:
            - All code in the `bindings` folder is generated by `tools/elixir_bindings.zig`
            - This is a neat Zig feature.
            - We define the data structures once (in TigerBeetle's core Zig code) and use compile-time reflection to automatically generate the correct Elixir binary matching patterns.
            -This reduces boilerplate and prevents errors if the core structures change.

            ---

            ```zig[]
            pub const Account = extern struct {
                id: u128,
                debits_pending: u128,
                debits_posted: u128,
                credits_pending: u128,
                credits_posted: u128,
                user_data_128: u128,
                user_data_64: u64,
                user_data_32: u32,
                reserved: u32,
                ledger: u32,
                code: u16,
                flags: AccountFlags,
                timestamp: u64,
            }
            ```

            ---

            ```zig[]
            const type_info = @typeInfo(Account);

            inline for (type_info.fields) |field| {
              // use field.name and field.type
            }
            ```

            notes:
            - Of course you can call @typeInfo on field.type
              - This gives info on the int sign, size etc

            ---

            ```elixir[]

              field :debits_posted, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
              field :credits_pending, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
              field :credits_posted, non_neg_integer(), default: 0

              field :user_data_32, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
              field :ledger, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
              field :code, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
              field :flags, AccountFlags.t(), default: %AccountFlags{}
              field :timestamp, non_neg_integer(), default: 0
            end
            ```
